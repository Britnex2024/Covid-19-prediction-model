COVID-19 Analysis and Forecasting Model
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and forecasting model for COVID-19, leveraging real-world data to uncover insights and predict trends. The project aims to support decision-making for policymakers and healthcare professionals through structured data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handled missing values and anomalies in variables such as confirmed, deaths, recovered, and others.
Created derived metrics, including mortality_rate, daily_growth_rate, and cases_per_100k.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized geographical and temporal trends in confirmed cases and deaths.
Examined variability in mortality rates across WHO regions.
Detected outliers in confirmed cases and deaths using boxplots.
Predictive Modeling

Applied time-series models (e.g., ARIMA) to forecast COVID-19 trends globally.
Evaluated model performance using RMSE to ensure accuracy.
Visual Insights

Line charts illustrating daily growth rates and trends over time.
Bar plots highlighting top countries by confirmed cases and deaths.
Boxplots for detecting variability and outliers in key metrics.
Automation
